# Ivy Playground for Bitcoin

The Ivy Playground for Bitcoin is an educational tool for trying out Ivy. It allows you to write contract templates, instantiate them with parameters to generate Bitcoin testnet addresses, create simulated contracts, and try spending those contracts with different arguments. 

The playground is a sandboxed environment for creating and unlocking mock contracts. It does not create any real transactions (on either the testnet or mainnet) or use any real bitcoins. However, it does compile your script to a Bitcoin (testnet) address and show you what that address would be, and it also allows you to see what arguments would be required to spend from that address.
